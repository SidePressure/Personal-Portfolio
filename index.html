	<h1>Welcome to my webpage. This is the home page, and also features some information about		<!-- Main page header -->
	my programming skills.</h1>
	
	<hr>
	<h2>C++ section</h2>

	<p>The main programming language that all of my classes from my associates degree where in was C++.<br>	<!-- Explanations about C++ -->
	Each week I would get a different program assignment, and usually they were simple things like prompting<br>
	the user for a list of numbers, and calculating the average, or making a simple menu where the user could <br>
	pick which options they wanted for a hypothetical payment plan.</p>

	<p>The hardest program I made in those classes was probably a small command prompt text based game<br>
	about a pig who was missing his truffles and needed your help to find them.</p>

	<p>Above this is a picture of some of the code from the pig and truffles game.<br>
	There are many more lines, but putting a picture of the entire program here seems unwieldy.<br>
	When executed, the program would open a command prompt window and give the user<br>
	hints as to which direction the "truffles" were in. If the user managed to find the truffles within<br>
	10 moves, the 10x10 space array that the game works in would be displayed, showing where<br>
	the user and truffles started, and the path they took to reach them. </p>

	<h2>Other programming languages</h2>							<!-- Section for other languages -->

	<p>I also took a class in x86 assembly, and I've done some minor dabbling in Java and an app creation<br>
	language called Kotlin. Now I'm working on my bachelor's degree in computer science, and I have several<br>
	classes in languages that I haven't used before, including the class this webpage was created for.</p>

	<p>Here you can see the four new programming related classes that I'm currently enrolled in:<br>
	Digital Forensics, Web Programming and Interface, Database, and Technical Communication for<br>
	Computing Professionals.</p>
