	<h1>This is the hobbies page. It has information on some of my more thinking and calculation based hobbies.</h1>
	
	<hr>
	<h2>Chess (E4 best by test)</h2>

	<p>The topics in this hobbies section of the webpage are not necessarily directly related to programming,<br>
	but you still have to strain your brain in a similar manner, between just straight up calculating the best move<br>
	in the given position, and trying to come up with a larger gameplan to outplay your opponent.</p>

	<p>The first one I want to feature here is chess, which is a combination of who can remember their opening<br>
	theory the better, who can calculate the farthest, who has the superior big picture strategy, and sometimes<br>
	when it comes down to it, who has the better intuation and faster reactions when you start to run out of time<br>
	on your clock.</p>

	<p>Above is a picture from a game that I was winning, but ended up losing because I spent too much time.<br>
	My favorite time format is 5 minute blitz, since the games are relatively short, but you have enough time<br>
	to calculate in particularly tricky or dangerous positions. I believe I topped out at a blitz ELO rating of 1982<br>
	which is well within the top 1% of players on chess.com.</p>

	<h2>Magic: The Gathering</h2>
	
	<p>The other game I want to take a look at here is Magic: The Gathering, or MTG or short.<br>
	MTG, like chess, involves a lot of calculation and plotting to try and outmanuever your opponent,<br>
	but it also has the added elements of luck and bluffing, as it is a card game.</p>

        	<div>

      	</div>	

	<p>This is a screenshot from a game of MTG (which I am completely losing, by the way).<br>
	My highest rank ever on one of the online versions of the game 'MTG Arena', was<br>
	Mythic #4 (in my preferred category, limited), which essentially translates to being the<br>
	fourth best player on the client.</p>
