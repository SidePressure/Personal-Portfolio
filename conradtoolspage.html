	<h1>This is the editing tools page. It has information on some of the photo and video editing software I use.</h1>

	<hr>
	<h2>Photo editers</h2>
	
	<p>As in the hobbies page on this site, the editing tools section is not directly related to programming,<br>
	but, I use these tools to create Youtube videos, and having the abililty to edit photos and video often comes<br>
	in handy when working on college assignments (like this one)</p>

	<p>Talking first about photo editers, the two main programs that I use are MS Paint, and Gimp. Paint has<br>
	fewer features by far, but it is also simpler, and the user interface is also much easier to use. If you need to<br>
	edit something quick and it doesn't need to be fancy, Paint is usually the easier option.</p>

      	</div>

	<p>Here's a screenshot of Paint, although most likely everybody already knows what it looks like.<br>
	Generally I only use Gimp when I need to do something that paint doesn't have the ability to do since<br>
	Gimp is harder to use. But, sometimes you just need to be more precise with your photo editing than<br>
	Paint can be.</p>

	<h2>Video Editing Software</h2>

	<p>The second topic in this tools page is video editing, which can still be useful for school projects on occasion.<br>
	In the past, the main video editor I used was Windows Movie Maker, but I believe it is no longer included<br>
	for free with Windows 10, so I had to find something else to use. I still wanted to find software that was free,<br>
	and what I ended up using is a program called Shotcut.</p>

        	<div>
		<img src="shotcut picture.png" alt="Shotcut video editor" width="1913" height="897">
      	</div>

	<p>Above is a picture of the editing timeline in Shotcut. It's not the greatest video editing software in the world,<br>
	but for a free download, it has been incredibly reliable for me so far. I've been using Shotcut for maybe 3-4 years<br>
	now, and while it does have some strange issues on occasion, I'm not sure how much more I can ask for without<br>
	being willing to pay for some premium video editing software such as Adobe Premier.</p>
